THESE PASSWORDS ARE NOT MEANT TO BE USED FOR REAL, <b>YOU'VE BEEN WARNED</b>

<h3>Why?</h3>
I made this generator with the intent purpose of giving examples of passwords a person might actually use, none of the gibberish the other password generators give you.<br> <br>

For example: <br>
<i>xa&&E1l2ox3t97uwrofr</i> - Try pronouncing that, let alone remembering it! <br>
<i>UnholyAmalgamationOfCode@1738</i> - is way catchier, easier to remember and about as secure as the first password.
<br>

<h3>How?</h3>
Making memorable passwords is relatively easy, you just need some creativity. <br>
Do you remember that verse of that obscure song only you know? Or a catchphrase you like that only you know? If all fails, come up with the filthiest combination of words possible, something you wouldn't dare to say out loud.<br> <br>
Write it down, add random numbers wherever you remember them. Same thing with symbols (@, !, $. #, etc). Play with upper and lowercase letters too.
<br>

<h3>Now what?</h3>
Here's a quick checklist of things to do to better secure your passwords (and your accounts): <br> <br>
<i>Write down your passwords</i> - Preferably in paper, since computers can be hacked and paper can't. <br>
<i>Don't recycle (your passwords)</i> - Always one password per account. <br>
<i>Use 2FA when possible</i> - Add an extra security step to logging into your account. <br>
<i>Avoid SMS 2FA</i> - SIM swapping makes SMS a less than ideal option for two factor authentication. Use an app when possible.
